The DILLIGAF License
                           Version 1

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION OR WHAT LITLE THERE ARE OF THEM

   1. The Licence

      Seriously. DILLIGAF means just that. What you do with this code is up to you. As with life, there are no guarantees of anything. 
      If you use this code and it destroys a lifetime of work and you've not backed it up, then more fool you and DILLIGAF? If you have backed it up,
      stop complaining, restore it, tell me what went wrong and if I fancy fixing it, I will. That said, the code is here for you to fix it
      yourself.

   2. What is DILLIGAF? 

      This link explains it perfectly : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a6EOyaMdqY

   3. Come on, you're not serious

      As the link says, I am.

   4. Really?

      Yes. If you want to use this code in one of your projects and become a multi-billionaire and claim it's yours, DILLIGAF. On the 
      otherhand, if you use it in your code and it causes you to become destitute, live on the streets, lose your dog (or any other pet),
      social standing or anything else like that, DILLIGAF. You chose to use it and accept these conditions for good or bad.

   5. Really? I mean really?

     Yes. This code was hacked together as I need something like this. It's not perfect by any means and it does what I need it to do. YMMV.
     If you use it, great. If you don't. DILLIGAF - your choice. 

  6. Who is Kevin "Bloody" Wilson?

     The guy who sang the song that insipred this licence. He's an Aussie and IMO, is extremely funny. Do I know him? No. Would I like to? Sure - why not.
     Next time he's in Townsville (and I am at the same time) or in Liverpool, perhaps it will happen.
